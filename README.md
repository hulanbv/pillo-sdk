## Development and Contribution

### Working on the Unity Packages

To start development on the Unity packages of the Pillo SDK, clone the entirety of this repository in your Unity project's `Assets` directory as if it were a normal asset. This will allow you to make changes to the packages and test them in your Unity project without having them to be installed via the Unity Package Manager.

### Working on the Native Libraries

To start development on the native libraries of the Pillo SDK, clone the entirety of this repository in any directory on your computer. Open this XCode project which can be found in the `Plugin` directory within the Pillo SDK Framework.

To test the native libraries in an actual Unity environment, a build must be made using the first step. This will generate an XCode project which can be opened and run on a physical device or simulator.
